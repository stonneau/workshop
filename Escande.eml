&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The objective of this workshop is to gather people =
working in the fields<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0of motion planning, trajectory optimisation, as wel=
l as real robot<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0control, and propose a debate on the combination of=

s in constrained<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0environments.<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The workshop will be divided in three sessions, wit=

&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0In order to enhance debate, we would require from t=
