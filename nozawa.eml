Dear Steve,

I'm Shunichi Nozawa.
Sorry for late reply and thank you very much for your kind invitation.
It is an honor for us to attend to the workshop.

I'll send a temporary title and abstract:

Title:
  Planning and execution of whole-body environment and object
manipulatoin with a life-sized humanoid robot

Abstract:
  In this presentation, we introduce planning and execution system for
whole-body environment and object manipulation with a life-sized
humanoid robot
  by adaptive selecting of manipulation strategy and robust motion
execution through haptic sensing of actual contact states and object's
motion.


If I need to send more information, please let me know.

Sincerely,
Shunichi Nozawa
