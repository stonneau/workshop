Physics-based manipulation under clutter and uncertainty
----
My research goal is to bridge the gap between what robots can do now and what they are capable of doing. Towards that goal, I will overview some of our recent work on (1) using physics to increase the repertoire of manipulation actions beyond pick-and-place to nonprehensile and whole-arm manipulation, (2) orchestrating this repertoire to reconfigure clutter, (3) using physics to funnel uncertainty via open-loop robust controllers, and (4) representing uncertainty via state estimators and reducing uncertainty via information-seeking actions.
----

Sidd.
